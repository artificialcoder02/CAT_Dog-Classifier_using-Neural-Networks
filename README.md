A cat-dog image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a computer program that can accurately classify images of cats and dogs. CNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for image recognition tasks because they can learn to recognize patterns in images.

To build this classifier, we can use Python and the TensorFlow Keras API, which provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks. Here are the steps we can follow:

Data collection: We need a dataset of cat and dog images to train and test our classifier. One common dataset is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which contains thousands of images of dogs and cats. We can download this dataset or collect our own images.

Data preprocessing: Before training the model, we need to preprocess the images by resizing them to a standard size, converting them to grayscale or RGB format, and normalizing the pixel values.

Model architecture: We can design our CNN model using Keras' Sequential API, which allows us to stack layers in a linear fashion. We can start with a convolutional layer, followed by a pooling layer, and then repeat these layers multiple times. The final layers should include one or more fully connected layers and a softmax layer for classification.

Model training: We can train our model using the prepared dataset. We can specify the loss function, optimizer, and metrics for evaluating the model's performance. We can also use techniques like data augmentation and dropout to improve the model's generalization.

Model evaluation: We can evaluate the model's performance using a separate validation set or cross-validation. We can compute metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to classify new images of cats and dogs. We can build a simple GUI application using Tkinter or any other GUI libraries for users to interact with the model.
